== Roxanne

Roxanne ("you don't have to put on the red line") is an hack'n'ship piece of software which controls an ethernet AC relay to display the CI status of several of our Hudson/Jenkins CI servers using a traffic light.

Many thanks to Tony Arcieri (http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2010/10/how-to-make-cheap-ci-traffic-light.html) for the original idea. We use a second-hand traffic light and an ethernet relay from GCE electronics (http://www.gce-electronics.com/40-ipx800-v200.html).
